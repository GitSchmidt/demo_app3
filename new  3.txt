1 rails new demo_app

2 take good gemfile

3 bundle install --without production

4b .gitignore

4c git add .
4d git commit -m "initial commit"

__following lines fix some first-time problem with git:
$ git config branch.master.remote origin
$ git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master

(__removing bad remote:
git remote rm origin)

git remote add origin git@github.com:GitSchmidt/demo_app3.git
git push -u origin master

rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string
(no space between : and string, otherwise there will be a name:string and string:string or something silly like that)

bundle exec rake db:migrate

added User1 and User2

rails generate scaffold Micropost content:string user_id:integer

bundle exec rake db:migrate

added 3 Microposts - 2 for id=1, 1 for id=2, hoping those match with the users above

in C:\Sites\demo_app3\app\models\micropost.rb:
  belongs_to :user
  validates :content, :length => { :maximum => 140 }

  
in C:\Sites\demo_app3\app\models\user.rb
 Added line (has_many :microposts )
 
 dann:
 
 rails console
 $first_user = User.first
 $ first_user.microposts
 
 -> this works without db:migrate (need to study what exactly is going on there)
 -> did not work previously when I messed up scaffolding and tried to correct columns and data types. Done from scratch works fine.
 
 leave console with "exit"

"error occured while installing sqlite3 (1.3.6)...
tried to comment out sqlite3 for heroku
- didnt work
checked git status: ah, my changes were not commited, so it tried to install sqlite on heroku which is not supported


heroku run rake db:migrate
